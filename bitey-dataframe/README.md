# Noleme Flow Connectors - Bitey Dataframe

A set of noleme-flow connectors for [tech.bitey/dataframe](https://github.com/biteytech/dataframe).
These are expected to ease the process of interfacing such dataframes with other systems as well as offer a few features for [noleme-vault](https://github.com/noleme/noleme-vault) configuration.

`noleme-flow-connect-bitey-dataframe` is currently super-early stage and purely experimental, if you want a more mature `noleme-flow` connector for dataframes, have a look at `noleme-flow-connect-tablesaw`.
